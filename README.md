# Pywfplan

Pywfplan is a Python library that helps planning the activity of a call
center.

It is based on a C++ application I wrote a few years ago that has been used in
production to plan call centers of sizes between 50 to 200 agents.

Pywfplan is a stripped down version of that application that retains the basic
functionality and exports it as a Python module.
